### CINEFLEX - FRONTEND
This application was created using React, and was one of my first frontend web apps. This is a movie theater ticketing website developed mainly for mobile screens.
In case the API used for the movies breaks at some point in the future, I may create my own backend for this application.

## Features
- List all movies;
- List all dates;
- Shows available seats for a determined movie;
- The user selects seats and confirms the ticket.



## How to run:

- Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Run in your terminal: 

```bash
docker-compose up nginx
```

- Access localhost:80 via browser
